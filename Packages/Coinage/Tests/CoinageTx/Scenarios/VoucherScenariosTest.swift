/// The voucher half of the durability scenarios, which the coin scenarios cannot reach.

/// A voucher is the only asset with positive consumption proof: its recycler alias reads as unloaded. A
/// coin has nothing equivalent — its absence is the strongest signal there is — so every rule that turns
/// on proven consumption or proven-not-unloaded is exercised here. Several cases also pin the iOS↔Android
/// parity fix: an archived or otherwise silent voucher reads UNKNOWN, never absent, so it never fails an
/// entry the way a coin's absence would.
