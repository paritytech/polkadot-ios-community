/// A service that monitors local vouchers and synchronizes their on-chain status.
///
/// Tracks every voucher the durability layer still cares about (`shouldTrackOnchain` — not spent, not
/// mint-failed), not just those outside a recycler: a ring keeps filling after a voucher lands in it, and
/// the member count is what the strategies read to decide when it may be spent. Two-phase per batch, held
/// together entirely by stream operators rather than in-memory
/// reconciliation:
/// 1. **Members**: subscribe `Members[collection][voucherPubKey]` for every voucher and `scan` the
///    per-key deltas into a complete positions snapshot.
/// 2. **RingKeysStatus + RecyclersUnloadedCount**: `flatMapLatest` re-derives the ring-state
///    subscription from the current positions and `scan`s its deltas into complete snapshots, then joins
///    them into the resolved location — onboarding, or in-recycler(ringIndex, ringMembers) — together
///    with the ring's fungibility, which is a function of those two readings and the ring capacity.
