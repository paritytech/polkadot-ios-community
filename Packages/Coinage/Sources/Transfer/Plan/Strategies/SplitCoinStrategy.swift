/// Strategy 2: split one coin into recipient and change denominations.

/// Only `overflowCoin` is consumed on chain, so it is the entry's single input — which is what
/// Appendix B says a split takes. `wholeCoins` are passed to the recipient untouched and are
/// recorded as handoffs rather than as inputs.
///
/// Both the recipient coins and the change coins are declared as outputs. Recording the
/// recipient side matters: an entry that declares only its change has no evidence left once
/// the peer claims, and cannot be told apart from one that never executed.
